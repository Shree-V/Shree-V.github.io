    <h1>Page 1 Fixes</h1>
    <p>These are all of the changes I made to Page 1 of the html code.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The table was missing a closing tag, so I went in and added that in right before the h2 heading.</li>
        <li>The opening html tag was missing was missing the language. There was just a warning for it on W3C, 
            but I went ahead and added it anyway</li>
        <li>There was a closing tag missing after Item 3 in the bulleted list, so I added that in.</li>
        <li>There was a closing paragraph tag missing on line 30, so I added that in too.</li>
        <li>There was another closing tag missing in the table after Cell 3 on line 36, so I added that in as well.</li>
        <li>Missing closing tag on line 42, so added that in.</li>  
        <li>Finally ran the W3C validation again and there were no remaining errors.</li>  
    </ul>

    <h1>Page 2 Fixes</h1>
    <p>These are all of the changes I made to Page 2 of the html code.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed closing tag missing for bold text on line 27.</li>
        <li>Fixed the alignment of the closing paragraph tag on line 31.</li>
        <li>Changed the order of the tag on line 53. I have the header tag first and then the bold text tag 
            nested inside the heading tag.</li>
        <li>Closing tag missing for heading on line 74, so I added that in.</li>
        <li>I added in the link to the wikipedia page for a segmental arch on line 57.</li>
        <li>I made sure that all of the paragraph tags (opening and closing) were matched up and properly lined up.</li>   
        <li>Finally ran the W3C validation again and there were no remaining errors.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h1>Page 3 Fixes</h1>
    <p>These are all of the changes I made to Page 3 of the html code.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I added the Doctype on the very first line.</li>
        <li>Added the language as English in the second line.</li>
        <li>Added a title to Page 3 since that was missing.</li>
        <li>Also, added the missing metas into the head since that was missing too.</li>
        <li>I also linked the css sheet in the head as well for some styling for Page 3.</li>
        <li>Finally ran the W3C validation again and there were no remaining errors.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h1>Page 4 Fixes</h1>
    <p>These are all of the changes I made to Page 4 of the html code.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I added the Doctype on the very first line.</li>
        <li>There were a couple missing opening tags for td and a missing closing tag for td that I added in.
            I forget exactly what lines the fixes were on, but I did make those edits. 
        </li>
        <li>The major change I made for this page had to do with all nine of the images on this page. Each one 
            of the images was missing an alt so I went in and added that for all of them.
        </li>
        <li>Finally ran the W3C validation again and there were no remaining errors.</li> 
    </ul>

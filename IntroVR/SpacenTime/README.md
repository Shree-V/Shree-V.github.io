This repository is going to be for this classes projects and assignments. In the future, I may end up using this repository for other personal projects as well. But for now, I'm just going to be using it for this class and to learn and explore a little bit. 

Here are a couple fun facts about me
I am immersed in the fine arts, so I dance, act, and model.
I love the combination of french fries and vanilla ice cream.
I have traveled to 6 out of the 7 continents. I don't think I'll ever go to Antarctica because it is too damn cold to live.

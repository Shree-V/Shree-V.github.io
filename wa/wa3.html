            <p>Bharathanatyam is an Indian Classical dance form that originated in the South Indian state of Tamilnadu.
                It is a combination of Bhava, Raga, Thala, and Natyam otherwise known as emotion, melody, rhythm, and dance
                hence the name Bharathanatyam.It is one out of eight of the main forms of Classical dance recognized in India.

            <h2 id="hist">History</h2>
            <p>The first theoretical foundations of Bharathanatyam are found in the Natya Shastra which is an ancient Sanskrit
                text by Bharatha Muni that is dated between 200 BCE and 200 CE. It details everything from different dance pieces,
                to the theory of expression and emotions, to postures and gestures, to basic steps, to acting techniques, etc. 
                Historically, Bharathanatyam has been all about bringing spiritual and religious stories and teachings to life 
                through dance. The art form was banned during the British rule of India. But, it was revived by various artists 
                during the Indian Independence Movement in the early 20th century.

            <h2 id="today">Bharathanatyam Today</h2>
            <p>Since the revival of Bharathanatyam in the early 20th century, it has evolved into a more modern art form. 
                It has become more modern in two different senses. On one hand, it is now used to tell a wider variety of stories
                instead of just stories from Indian mythology and Hinduism. Now, Bharathanatyam is used to tell not only spiritual
                stories but also stories that resonate with a much broader audience. On another hand, the movements and the way that 
                Bharathanatyam is performed has become much more theatrical and intricate to maintain uniqueness in each piece 
                and engage the audience for longer periods of time. In short, Bharathanatyam has a much bigger focus on the audience
                now than it did before.

Shreenija Vadayar and Destiny Cool's Final Game Project for ATLS 2270

The game we have created for our final project is a collection game. There is a cat that moves around the screen trying to collect good items (fish and food cans) while avoiding bad items (nail clippers and spray bottles) and trying not to get caught by the dog. There are 3 levels total with the complexity and difficulty increasing at each level through the addition of multiple dogs. 

All of the code for this project is in one Python file: something-fishy.py. 

All of the images used in the code are downloadable and included in an images folder in our submitted zip folder. 

All of the sound files used in the code are downloadable and included in a sounds folder in our submitted zip 
folder. 

We hope you enjoy our game!!
